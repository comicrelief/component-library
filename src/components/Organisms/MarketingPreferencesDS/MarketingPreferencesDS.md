Marketing Preferences DS

This component exists purely to show the Marketing Preferences component functioning within the Component Library; applications are to provide their own react-hook-form form and validation, based on these.

```js
import MarketingPreferencesDSForm from './MarketingPreferencesDSForm';

<MarketingPreferencesDSForm />

```
