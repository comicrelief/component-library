# Email SignUp Form

**DEPRECATED**: This component is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Please use `EmailBanner` instead, which provides the same functionality with improved design.

### EmailSignUpForm.js is just a wrapper for viewing in the CL
### The email sign up component that is used/exported is _EmailSignUp.js

```js
import EmailSignUpForm from './EmailSignUpForm';
import Text from '../../Atoms/Text/Text';

<>
    <Text tag="p">This EmailSignUpForm component exists purely to show the EmailSignUp component functioning within the Component Library; applications are to provide their own react-hook-form form and validation, based on these.</Text>

    <EmailSignUpForm />
</>
```
